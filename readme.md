# Roguelike game

This is a mostly incomplete implementation of a roguelike game in rust, this is mostly inspired from [this excellent tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/), whilst the approach hugely remains sam,  this project is different in the way the code is structured and implemented, and is a bit more rust friendly.
